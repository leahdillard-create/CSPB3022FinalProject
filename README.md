# CSPB3022 Final Project: World Health Predictors and Life Expectancy

## Problem:
World health is at the epicenter of public information via the news media ever since the Coronavirus pandemic. 
However, despite the craze, it is still important to higlight the baselines of health, which include socioeconomic and disease data! 
These issues and their relationship to lower life expectancy will be explored in the context of developed vs developing countries.

## Motivation:
The main goal is to determine if GDP (external threat) has a more profound impact on life expectancy of adults than disease/BMI (external threat) 
per country status using regression analysis and multiple models to draw conclusions to what trending data might suggest in the future.

## Dataset:
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mathchi/life-expectancy-who-with-several-ml-techniques/data
- This Dataset has been compiled from information merged by the World Health Organization and the United Nations website, including data from 193 countries. All of the factors involved are directly related to health, but the United Nations includes data that is socioeconomic in nature as well.
- This dataset is large, with 22 Columns and 2938 rows and 20 predicting variables.
- There are 18 numerical and 2 categorical features.
- Not all data was able to be acquired, so less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde were not included due to lack of accurate information.
